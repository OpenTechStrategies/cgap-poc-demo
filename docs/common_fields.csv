,Field,Notes
,,"How this list was made: We looked at the common grant application fields across 9 funder and funder-support organizations.  We selected the fields that were both common and were either fairly static (like org name, address, etc) or quantitative (like org annual budget, fiscal year, proposal budget, etc).  Please note that this is still very much a draft!  Comments and feedback are welcome."
,,
Organization:,,
,Org Name,
,Org Mission Statement,
,Org Website,
,"Org Entity Type (i.e., Tax Status)",
,Org Registration Number (EIN / TIN),
,Org Address,
,Org Phone,
,Org Email,
,Org DBA Name,
,Org Legal Docs (articles of incorporation?  tax status affirmation?),
,Org Board Members (names and affiliations),
,"Org CEO (or ""Org Administrative Lead""): name, title, address, bio?",
,Org Annual Operating Budget,
,Org Lobbying Activities (this might be a yes/no question),
,"Org Start Date (""date commenced operations"")",
,"Org Geographic Areas (""In which geographic areas does your organization work?"")",
,Org Audited Financial Statements (last two years) OR Balance Sheet and Income Statement,Not sure about this one... it only had a total score of 3.
,Org Grant Agreement Signatory,
,Org Fiscal Year End Date,Presumably the end date implies the start date.
,,
Proposal:,,
,Proposal Name(s),"This may be a questionable & possibly sensitive field.  The same basic proposal may travel to different funders under different names, and it's not clear that the proposer necessarily wants each funder to see the ""other"" names.  So we're listing this as a field for now, but more discussion is needed to decide whether/how to include it.  One possibility is that it is included, in the sense that CGAP has the names and can match against them in topic-based searches, but that they are (at the grantseeker's option) confidential and never actually displayed to others.  However, if we already include Proposal Executive Summary or Proposal Description as a field, then we probably don't additionally need the Proposal Name(s) as something to match on in searches, in which case the prudent approach might be to just not collect the name data in the first place."
,Proposal Primary Contact Name,
,Proposal Budget,
,Proposal Investment Start Date,"Alt: ""Project/Grant/Investment Length"" (or ""Duration"")"
,Proposal Investment End Date,^^ ditto
,"Proposal Project Total Budget (including other funders, over entire duration)",
,Proposal Fiscal Sponsorship Org Name,Presumably the fiscal sponsor gets an Organizational entry of its own too.
,Proposal Executive Summary?  Proposal Description?,"This is a somewhat looser field than the others, but maybe still necessary?"
,,
Misc Notes:,,
, ,"Interestingly, SDGs are nowhere represented here (and are not represented in the combined data in the original ""App Compare and Contrast (extended)"" sheet either)."
,,
,,We might want to talk about ways to how to handle fiscal sponsorship relationships.
