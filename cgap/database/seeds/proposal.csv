Ironically, in post-disaster settings, women are portrayed as passive survivors, ignoring their multiple talents and potential capabilities in the field of reconstructions, and impacting equal access to resources of humanitarian assistance. aWASH aims to pilot an eco-based WASH project for post-disaster shelters in Indonesia by introducing the use of a solar sater pump to provide an energy-efficient alternative to traditional electric and fuel-driven pump sets. The project aims at preventing a rise in non-renewable energy demand and empowering disaster-affected communities through domestic solar power.",3: Good Health and Well-being; 5: Gender Equality; 6: Clean Water and Sanitation; 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

There are approximately 795 million hungry people in the world today and more than 70% of them live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. EHN seeks to grow lasting solutions to hunger through sustainable food security programs in developing countries. We do this by:
• Building on community assets to foster ownership and empower leaders in order to address the root causes of chronic hunger;
• Bringing innovative ideas to new places and promoting experimentation;
• Partnering with local organizations to strengthen their skills and encourage their passion and desire for change.
With funding, ENH will serve 5,000 people with sustainable food security programming over the next 2 years, while engaging and leveraging the support of new communities in the US so that we can serve another 10,000 by 2025.",2: Zero Hunger

This represents over three quarters of Black Americans but less than half of White Americans. Literacy is the key to addressing the consequences of systemic racism in educational and employment outcomes for families. Working with trusted local partners in Jackson, MS, we will integrate literacy-based learning modules in key subjects (digital, financial, health) into adult education programs at the neighborhood level, meeting learners where they live, work, play, and pray. Sites will be staffed by supporting digital navigators and case managers. Corporate partners will provide employment opportunities upon completion. Our longitudinal study will ultimately prove our program’s ability to drive employment, self-sustainability, and higher educational attainment for future generations through literacy—ultimately closing the racial equity gap for America’s marginalized families.",1: No Poverty; 4: Quality Education

Child disability is especially high in India where access to appropriate assistive devices such as wheelchairs is a big challenge. Mobility for the Children of India, Inc. aims to eliminate physical immobility for every disabled child in India. We will do this through discovery, development and delivery. Discovery will generate data and evidence on child physical disability. Through harmonizing child disability measurement, we will determine the true size of child population that need wheelchairs. Development will change the ecosystem of wheelchair production and procurement in India by establishing strong local production and supply system for appropriate and affordable wheelchairs. Delivery will ensure that every child with physical immobility gets appropriate wheelchair in India. For children, wheelchairs offer more than mobility; they ensure independence, health, development and social integration.",3: Good Health and Well-being; 10: Reduced Inequalities

There is no precedence for managing a peaceful existence of nine billion people on the planet, no manual to guide us. This calls for intense experimentation with new ideas. Hence, the concept of a global laboratory for sustainability innovation. We have launched The New Environmental Initiative to this end. Rooted in sound science, creative experimentation, and radical innovation, the concept of our lab is also unique in scope. It embraces the whole planet, the integrity and health of its biosphere, and the wellbeing of humanity. Just as the large defense laboratories assembled extraordinary talent to develop weapons of unimaginable destructive power, the New Environmental Initiative aims to harness worldwide talent to address urgent sustainability-related issues facing us all.",11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; 13: Climate Action; 12: Responsible Comsumption and Production

Portland Transitional Housing Services solves this issue by providing a transitional period to the homeless population we serve. Many times residents leave the shelter without being adequately equipped to sustain their housing and end up returning to the shelter again and again. Portland Transitional Housing Services assists the homeless by teaching responsibility that leads to long-term financial independence and permanent housing. Residents will pay rent and utilities in the transitional housing, learn budgeting, and how to plan for potential life crisis that we all deal with everyday, thus, reducing the cycle of chronic homelessness within the Portland community.",1: No Poverty

This grant can provide funds to solve a problem that the federal government has grappled with for decades. Social media data provides a rich source of information about public perception, attitudes, and behaviors that our team proposes to analyze using proven scientific methods.
